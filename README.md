# Roblox-bot-detector
Read the comments in the python script to figure out how to configure it.\
Fully scanning a big game will take ages.

- How does this work?
  - This works by hashing the thumbnails and then comparing the hash to the other thumbnails in that server, if 2 thumbnails have a similar hash it will count them as bots.

Credits to kanibals on discord for improving the script.

Planning on adding this to RoValra at some point
